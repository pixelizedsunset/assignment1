            This web page is dedicated to humanity's favorite
            amphibian: the humble frog! Here at The Frog Appreciation Page,
            we aim to remedy the tragic reality that frogs, though
            incredible, often do not receive the love and attention that they
            deserve in their day-to-day lives. How? By putting the spotlight
            on our favorite frogs!
          </p>

          <p class="center">
            Every week, our team ranks local frogs to highlight the diverse
            magnificence found in order <i>Anura</i>. This week's top three overall
            best frogs are listed below! To read their bios, scroll below, or use
            the button directory to "hop" to any particular ranking! Have fun!

            <h5 class="center">"Arnold"</h5>
            <p class="center"><i>
              Species: American Bullfrog <br>
              Gender: Male <br>
              Personality: Quiet

            <p class="center">
              Arnold can be a little shy, but once you get to know
              him, he'll be your truest life-long friend. He enjoys
              eating moths and long walks on the pavement. The only
              reason he was not ranked higher was because the way he
              stares at people can be a little off-putting, but maybe
              he'll make it to #1 Frog next week!

              Majora is the definition of small but mighty!
              Despite her petite frame, Majora is a perpetually-angry,
              ready-to-rumble frog. Even though she is rude, she has
              earned this week's #2 Frog rank because she ate a bug
              that was terrorizing one of our web managers. A guardian angel!

            <br>
            <p class="center">
              Mr. Grumpy has a very unfortunate name, for he is not
              grumpy in the slightest. In fact, if you speak with him,
              you'll find that he is perhaps the kindest soul in amphibian
              history! Mr. Grumpy is fascinated by mushrooms and often suns
              himself in our lead web developer's garden. When asked what
              his favorite type of mushroom is, he responded with the following:
              <i>"Croak ribbit ribbit croak croak."</i>
              Unfortunately, our translator was away for the weekend and we were
              unable to understand what he meant by this.
